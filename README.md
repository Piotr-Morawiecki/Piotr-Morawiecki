### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am educator and researcher, who specialises in the industrial mathematics. I worked on research projects for a wide range of industries (see my website: https://people.bath.ac.uk/pwm27/research.html), but my main specialisation is modelling of physical processing, especially in the field of fluid dynamics. 

My main project is focused on developing analytic benchmarks for the hydrologic models, with applications in flood modelling, which is the outcome of a long-term collaboration between the University of Bath and UK's Environment Agency. Repositories found on my GitHub account can be used to easily reproduce all the results of my work. I hope this will be inspiring for other researchers in the field of hydrology, in which sharing data and codes is still extremely rare.

In case of any comments, feel free to message me!
